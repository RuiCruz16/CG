## Use of AI in the Project

- **Ellipsoid Modeling:** The ellipsoid is a complex object that requires parametric equations for its construction. Using AI helped simplify the implementation by generating the necessary logic to calculate the vertices, normals, and texture coordinates based on the ellipsoid's parametric equations.

- **Shaders:** Shaders were used to implement dynamic and time-based effects, such as fire animation and texture transitions. AI was particularly helpful in understanding and applying functions like smoothstep, step, and mix, which were unfamiliar to us. These functions allowed us to achieve the desired effects, such as sine and cosine waves for fire dynamics, texture alternation for the heliport, and blinking lights.

- **Helicopter:** For modeling the helicopter, AI was helpful with the ellipsoid (as mentioned earlier), which is used in the helicopter's main body and some connection points. Regarding direction and velocity calculations, AI explained and partially implemented the logic for determining the helicopter's direction vector based on key presses. Since the direction is influenced by the helicopter's orientation, it helped derive the formulas for calculating the forward direction and velocity, ensuring precise movement and speed control. Additionally, AI was used to create a smooth and gradual effect for increasing or decreasing the rotation speed of the rotors, adding realism to the helicopter's behavior during takeoff, flight, and landing.
