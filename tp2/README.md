## TP 1 Notes

- In Exercises 1 and 2, we gained an understanding of the fundamentals of the CGF library. As well as the basics for drawing objects in WebGL, considering a set of triangles.

- Initially, the biggest difficulty was understanding the correct order in which to place the indices to represent the vertices of each triangle. After a few tests, we concluded that when ordered in a counter-clockwise direction, the object is visible from the front of the reference.
